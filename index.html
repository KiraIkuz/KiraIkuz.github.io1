            <h1>About Me</h1>
            Hi there! My name is Juliette, and my passion is video games! I love playing them, but I specifically want to know how to make them! I love cooking, and my cats, and it honestly makes my day to hear about the wonderful and amazing Meowharaja Siggy.

            <h3>My Goals In Life, Not Soccer</h3>
            My goal in life is to become an indie game developer. Maybe not big time, but I at least want to make a moderate amount of fans in the future. If I ever got to the level of Balatro or Stardew as an independent indie creator, my life goal would be met.

            <h2>Link to Great Study Music</h2>
            This is one of my favorite games, and one of my favorite things to listen to while I do notes/study. I got the idea when the professor talked about Tears of the Kingdom music (amazing game btw, highly recommend)
